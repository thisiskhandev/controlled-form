Controlled component vs uncontroll
I worked only on controlled components
https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html

Q) What is _Controlled Component?_
A) Our main component which has the power over attribute, in our case App.jsx is controlled component.
value = {NeedComponentToAccessThisAttr}

Q) What is _Uncontrolled Component?_
A) When we write some attribute in simple html site it is uncontrolled
for e.g:
value = "You can write anything!"
